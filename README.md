# ChatBot
This is a mini project featuring a ChatBot powered by ChatGPT.
The objective of this project is to put into practice the knowledge about the functioning of chatGPT acquired in the mini course 'ChatGPT Prompt Engineer for Developers' of Deep Learning.AI (Of which I also have notes in my Notion).
In this repository, you will find 3 programs that can be copied and executed in a Jupyter notebook.<br />
<b>Remember that in the initialization section, the 'openai.api_key' variable should be assigned your corresponding OpenAI key</b>
